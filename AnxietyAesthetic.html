      <h2 style="font-family: vintage">Historically, Anxiety has by no means always been recognized as a potential mental disorder.Before getting to the history of this disorder, it's important to note that anxiety is part of the evolution. Is an activation of the fight or flight sytem, systemt that your body uses to keep you save from harm. We need to realize that being nervous when confronting fear is not anxiety. Instead, anxiety is when you get nervous when there is no fear. We can say that anxiety is when your fight or flight system is malfunctioning. Anxiety disorders were officially recognized in the 1980 by the American Psychiatric Association. Before it was recognized, medical professionals were giving diagnosis of "nerves" or "stress". They had no training and had a little understanding about anxiety: very few people was receiving an effective treatment. </h2>
        <br>
        <a id="anxiety"> <h1 style="font-family: vintage"><font size="+25">♥What is Anxiety?</font></h1></a>
        <h2 style="font-family: vintage">Anxiety is a feeling of fear, dread, and uneasiness. Is typically about an imminent event with an certain outcome or results. It is anticipating to the future and creating scenarios that may not happen but we still imagine it. Psychiatric speaking, is an emotion and a mental condition that can be characterized by tension, worried thoughts, physical changes, and an excessive apprehensiveness about perceived threats. Anxiety is a normal reaction to stress and that can be beneficial in some situations. It can lead to avoid certain behaviors.

                    ♥Generalized Anxiety Disorder</font></h2>
       
        
        <h2 style="font-family: vintage">Generalized Anxiety Disorder is characterized by a persitent and excessive feeling of worry about a large number of different things. People with this disorder may anticopate disaster and excessively be worried about issues as work, studies, or family. They may find it difficult to control their worry. They may worry more than seems about actual events or even expect the worst when there is no reason to be concerned. It is diagnosed to people who finds it difficult to control worry on most days than not for at least six months.The generalized anxiety disorder affects 6.8 million adults, or 3.1% of the U.S population, in any given year. Women are twice as likely to be affected. The disorder can be diagnosed to any life cycle, though the risk of having the disorder can affect between the childhood and middle age. There's no exact cause of the disorder, there's evidence that can be biological factors, family background, and life experience. People with General Anxiety Disorder may experiment symptoms like feeling restless, having difficulty to concentrate, unexplained pains, worry too much and having difficult to fall asleep or staying asleep.</h2>

        <h2 style="font-family: vintage">People with panic disorder can experiment frequent and unexpected panic attacks. Some of the panic attack's symptoms are: sweating, chest pain, nausea,abdominal distress, trembling, fear of losing control or dying, etc. Some others symptoms or signs of panic disorder are sudden and repeated panick attacks of overwhelming anxiety and fear, an intense worry about when the next panic attack will happen, or a fear/avoidance of places where panic attacks have ocurred in the past. 


           <br><br> Panic Disorder is generally treated with psychotherapy, medication, or both. In psychotherapy, there's a therapy called Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). It is commonly used to treat this disorder. It teaches different ways of thinking, behaving, and reacting to the feelings that happens before or during a panic attack. With this therapy, you can learn how to react differently to the physical sensations of anxiety that helps to reduce the frequency of having panic attacks. Other method of helping people with this disorder is with medications. You may talk to a health care provider and they may prescribe medication to treat panic disorder. There are different types of medicine, such as antidepressants, beata-blocker and anti-anxiety medications. Seledctive Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors and Serotonin-Norepinephrine Reuptake Inhibitors antidepressants are common medicine to treat depression, but they can help to treat symptoms of panic disorder. Beta-Blockers, normally, helps to control some of the physical symptoms of a panic disorder. But health cae providers do not commonly prescribe this medicine for this disorder. <br><br>Some of the symptoms and signs are: 
            <br>-Pounding or racing heart
        <br>-Trembling
        <br>-Hard to breath
        <br>-Dizziness
        <br>-Chest Pain</h2>

                     width=800></center><h1 style="font-family: vintage"><font size="+25">♥Social Anxiety Disorder</font></h1>
        
        <h2 style="font-family: vintage">This is a common type of anxiety disorder. People with this disorder may feel anxious or fear in situations that they may be evaluated or judged by others. It can be concerns about being humiliated, judged, and rejected. 
        The fear that those people with this disorder may experience in social situations is so intense that they feel that is beyond their control. Some people may feel fear on the way to work or school, or doing daily stuff. For others, they may able do normal things, susch as accomplish activities, but experience a great amount of fear or anxiety when they do. People with Social Anxiety Disorder may be anxious or fear even if it's weeks before the social activity is due. There are moments that people cancel any activity or avoid going to places or events to avoid any feelings of embarrassment. 
        <br>
        <br>Social anxiety disorder usually starts during the late childhood and may resemble extreme shyness or they avoid any social interactions. It occurs more frequently in females than in males. This gender difference is more pronounced in adolescents and young adults. If it is not treated, may last for many years, or even a lifetime. It can be treated with psychoterapy or medication. Saying this is for those who need to get treated. Personally I have both.
